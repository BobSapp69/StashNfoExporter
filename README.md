# Issue
If Movie poster is not showing you can add local ip (192.168.xxx.xxx) in config instead of localhost and readd the library. 

# Conclusion
I just created this plugin as the https://github.com/scruffynerf/StashNfoExporterKodi was broken after 24.1.

There will be issues which I don't know yet so pls report them in issues Thanks !
