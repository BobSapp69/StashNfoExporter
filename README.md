# StashNfoExporter
Export .nfo from Stash for services like Kodi

# Usage
Clone the repo to plugins folder of stash

# What it does ?
It will automatically create "movie.nfo" for all the organized files at the same directory of the video file when any movie is added or updated .

You can change organized to False if you want.

Api key can be added in config if you have one.

# Conclusion
I just created this plugin as the https://github.com/scruffynerf/StashNfoExporterKodi was broken after 24.1.

There will be issues which I don't know yet so pls report them in issues Thanks !
